[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9cl2i5x0j2rlwgih/branch/main?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gibbed/gibbed-letusclingtogether/branch/main)

## Targets

Intended to work with all available regional versions of the game, though only the following have been tested:

* JP (`ULJM05753`): タクティクスオウガ　運命の輪
    * Tactics Ogre: Unmei no Wa
    * Tactics Ogre: Wheel of Fortune
* US (`ULUS10565`): Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together
* EU/AU (`ULES10500`): Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together

## What?

*Experimental!*

* `UnpackFILETABLE`: Unpacker for `FILETABLE.BIN` (and corresponding `.BIN` files).
* `PackFILETABLE`: Packer for `FILETABLE.BIN` (and corresponding `.BIN` files).
* `LookupFILETABLE`: Translates offsets in `.BIN` files to their corresponding file entries.
* `ExportSprite`: Exporter for sprite data (`*.sprite`)— incomplete, still needs work.

## TODO

* Everything.
